<h1>Project Overview</h1>

Welcome!
This is the first part of the project, where we use concepts as linked lists, double-linked lists and sequential lists.
To illustrate it, so you can see the structures properly running, we made a user interface where you can interact with. You'll be able to insert numbers into the lists, search and also remove them by position or by number itself.

For this purpuse, we used Python as main language, using specially the pygame library to build the user interface.
